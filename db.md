## NewSQL
[NewSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewSQL) is a class of modern relational database management systems 
that seek to provide the same scalable performance of NoSQL systems for online transaction processing (OLTP) 
read-write workloads while still maintaining the ACID guarantees of a traditional database system.
